# Activity 1.1.5

## Requirements
1. Add the features to 114 according to the PLTW activity [pltw 115](https://pltw.read.inkling.com/a/b/71ce293152cf4873b7395f3d59c64a57/p/eaa565b3fdff4caf934e512a8ad2bfad)
2. Complete the Read me, Here or copy paste into a doc then import the PDF to repository
3. Random implementation via loops. The program should use loops as implementation to a problem.
4. Complete the activity pair programming with your table partner.
   
   * Be sure to remain in your seats working with your partner
   * Both students should sign on to repository.
   * Both Students should implement the program in one project.

## Action Items
1. Add a binary search algorithm component
2. Add a visual component to the app to show the user what they have guessed.

---

* Utilize this read me to showcase the project.
* Be sure to read and use the markdown here:
[MarkDown Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
* [Stack Edit for markdown editing](https://stackedit.io)

* Write a description of what the program does, who is it for?
```

## 1.1.5 Guessing Game \- One Player

## 

### Pair Programming\!\!\!\! **:**

Summarize what pair programming is & describe characteristics of successful pair programming teams.
```

```

## Using Loops & Implementing a Loop:

In programming, what is a loop?
```

```

What does it mean to increment?
```


```

### Using Variables in Loops, Using Local Variables, While Loop to Generate a Random Number, While Loops Inside a Local Variable, & Incrementing Variables Through Counted Loops: 

1-18 Insert a screenshot of your code here. Did you run into any errors? If so, what were they and how did you fix them?
```


```

### Resetting the App Play & Hiding the Secret Number: 

19-24 Insert your NEW code only: 
```

```

## Using a Clock to Countdown: 

25-39 Insert a screenshot of your work here (Designer View, Blocks View (make sure I can see your comments\!\!\!) & a screenshot from using the app on your phone).  Note: I will want to see your app running in class with all of your personalized changes\!\!

```


```

## CONCLUSION:

1\.   What are two distinct difficulties or opportunities you encountered and how were they resolved or incorporated?

```


```

2\. Describe the incremental and iterative development process of your program.

```


```

3\.  Consider the backlog that you learned about in the previous activity. Choose an app that you want to make or another as directed by your teacher. Using this app as context, create three user stories for the app. Be sure to include:

* What features address the user story  
  * What the user interface looks like throughout the user story  
  * What data the app collects during this user story  
  * What output the app produces during this user story


```


```

  

  4\.  How did you interpret and respond to the [Essential Questions](https://pltw.read.inkling.com/a/b/71ce293152cf4873b7395f3d59c64a57/p/eaa565b3fdff4caf934e512a8ad2bfad#f6cb8e11689a4270b18ccb018d8cc56a)? Capture your thoughts for future conversations.
